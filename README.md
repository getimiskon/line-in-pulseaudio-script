# Line in loopback script for PulseAudio v1.0

This script enables/disables the loopback module from PulseAudio. I made that script to automate this process than typing those commands individually.

## How to use the script:

Open a terminal window and go to the directory of the script, give the permissions needed to execute it and run it. The instructions are already in the script.

If you have any problems with the sound, change the latency value.
